BAMG3; calculating membership probability of nearby young moving groups

Steps.
1. Download BAMG3.zip and unzip the file.
2. run calc_onestar.py
3. type parameters as the code asks and see the results.

You can modify the code (calc_onestar.py) to calculate membership probability for a number of stars.

Warning.
If a star has a very low data uncertainty (e.g., epmra/pmra < 0.0001), the code gives NaN result. In that case, you need to increase data uncertainty.
This issue will be resolved.
